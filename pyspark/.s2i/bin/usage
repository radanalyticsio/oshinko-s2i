This is the daikon-pyspark S2I image:
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Sample invocation:

s2i build git://<source code> daikon-pyspark <application image>

You can then run the resulting image.

To run, you must supply the name of a spark cluster to use (it
will be created if it does not exist), the name of the
specific python file from the source repository that should be
passed to spark-submit, and the ip address of an oshinko rest controller.

$ docker run -e OSHINKO_CLUSTER_NAME=mycluster -e OSHINKO_REST=<ip of an oshinko rest controller> -e APP_FILE=app.py <application image>
