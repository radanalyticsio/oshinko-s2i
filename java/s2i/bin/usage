This is the radanalytics-java-spark S2I builder image. It will build
a java spark application image using the maven project in the specified
github repository and the resulting image may be used to run your spark
application.

By default, this s2i image will build the maven project with the following
command:

   $ mvn package dependency:copy-dependencies -Popenshift -DskipTests -e

See https://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/s2i_images/java.html for more
information on maven options.

To use it, first install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Usage: s2i build <github repo> radanalytics-java-spark <application image name>

Example:

    $ s2i build git://github.com/mygithub/wordcount.git radanalytics-java-spark mynewapp

The resulting application image contains a startup script that expects the following required and
optional environment variables which can be set when the application is launched:

    OSHINKO_CLUSTER_NAME -- name of the spark cluster to use or create, required
    OSHINKO_REST         -- ip of the oshinko-rest controller, required
    SPARK_OPTIONS        -- options to spark-submit, e.g.  "--conf spark.executor.memory=2G --conf spark.driver.memory=2G"
    APP_MAIN_CLASS       -- name of the main class, required
    APP_ARGS             -- arguments to the python application (if the app takes arguments)
    OSHINKO_DEL_CLUSTER  -- if a new cluster is created and this flag is set to "true" then the
                            cluster will be deleted when the python application completes. The
                            default behavior is to leave the cluster.
    APP_EXIT             -- if this value is unset or set to "false" then the script will
                            loop forever after the spark application completes. To have the
                            script exit, set this value to "true"
